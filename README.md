# Identifying-bicycle-damage.
General objective: "Quality assessment system for rented bicycles" aims to establish a system for evaluating damaged parts of bicycles after rental, thereby calculating the amount that renters must pay. This system helps rental providers check the quality of bicycles on the system without manual inspection.

Specific objectives:

Understand the characteristics and operating principles of the modules used in the project.
Learn how to connect ESP32-Cam with CP2102 to capture images and input them into the model.
Set up a dataset with classes representing possible damage faults on bicycles.
Learn about the YOLO algorithm and related algorithms.
Train the YOLOv5 model.

Summary of key results of the project:

Detect bicycles and evaluate the extent of damage.

Calculate the cost that renters need to pay and display the results on the screen.
